I'll make the first commit here in the readme.md. That way you can all yell n00b here instead of in the code. PoW is an area that I would love to see change in. I want the definition changed from 'mining' to actual 'work done' when the tokens are spent. This is important for things like medical or dental histories.
First commit.
```rust struct Blockchain { // Blockchain structure } struct Block { // Block structure } struct ProofOfStake { // Proof of Stake mechanism implementation } struct ProofOfHistory { // Proof of History mechanism implementation similar to Solana } struct ProofOfWork { // Proof of Work mechanism implementation } struct ProofOfAI { // Proof of AI mechanism implementation } impl Blockchain { fn add_block(&mut self, new_block: Block) { // Add a new block to the blockchain } fn validate_chain(&self) -> bool { // Validate the entire blockchain true } } impl ProofOfStake { fn validate_stake(&self) -> bool { // Validate the stake in the blockchain true } } impl ProofOfHistory { fn secure_order_time(&self) { // Securing order and time of transactions } } impl ProofOfWork { fn mine_block(&self) { // Mine a new block } fn validate_work(&self) -> bool { // Validate real-life work true } } impl ProofOfAI { fn validate_ai(&self) { // Validate Proof of History, Proof of Work, and Proof of Stake using AI } } fn main() { let mut blockchain = Blockchain {}; // Example: Add a new block using Proof of Work let pow = ProofOfWork {}; pow.mine_block(); if pow.validate_work() { let new_block = Block {}; blockchain.add_block(new_block); } // Example: Validate blockchain using Proof of Stake let pos = ProofOfStake {}; if pos.validate_stake() { let is_valid = blockchain.validate_chain(); if is_valid { // Blockchain is valid } } // Example: Using Proof of AI mechanism let poai = ProofOfAI {}; poai.validate_ai(); } ```
Come on people, do First Contact and reach out to me as I am to all of you. We can get the Web3 token operational while we are at it too. At least it has multiple use cases already.
